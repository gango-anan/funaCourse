# funaCourse
funaCourse is a HTML&CSS Capstone project undertaken to fulfill the requirements of the Microverse Full Stack Web Developer program. The word 'funa' is derived from my native language which loosely translates to "find". funaCourse is a web system that acts as a gateway for finding an online coding course with a lot of ease

This project is base on the original design of 'PATASHULE' by Mathew Njuguna on Behance(https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE). I would thank Mathew for the elegant design and for giving me the opportunity to up my design skills by replicating what you already designed.
